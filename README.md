arVolumeControl
==============

What
--------------

This is the embedded arduino code used by my Kenwood KA-3500 volume control project.  It is my first adventure in Arduino development.

The code runs on an arduino micro.

The key items in this code are
- Sony IR decoding for remote control use
- An LED driver
- Interface with PGA2311 digital volume control chip via SPI
- Gray code rotary encoder interface
